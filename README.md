# 🌾 AgroSetu - Empowering Smallholder Farmers

**Team Name**: Tech_Stack  
**Solution Challenge 2025**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Smallholder farmers, who produce a significant portion of the world’s food, often lack access to advanced tools and technologies. This results in lower crop yields, inefficient resource use, and increased vulnerability to climate change, threatening global food security.

**AgroSetu** is a comprehensive, integrated **web and mobile platform** combined with an **IoT solution**, created to empower smallholder farmers with real-time insights, community support, and AI-powered recommendations.

Our platform bridges critical gaps by providing direct market access, crop health diagnostics, resource optimization, expert consultations, and more — ensuring scalability, affordability, and sustainability for farmers in developing regions.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Marketplace**: Farmers can **buy and sell crops**, farming equipment, and search for **cold storage** facilities directly — reducing dependency on middlemen.
- **Real-Time Government Updates**: Access to the latest **government policies**, **MSP (Minimum Support Price)** updates, and farming schemes.
- **AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection**: Farmers upload images of their crops, and an **ML model** detects potential diseases and suggests remedies.
- **IoT Integration**: Solar-powered **IoT devices** monitor farm conditions (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, gas levels) and enable **automatic irrigation** based on real-time data.
- **Expert Consultations**: Farmers can connect with **agriculture experts** for personalized advice.
- **Multilingual Support**: The platform supports **multiple regional languages** for wider accessibility.
- **Farmer Self-Help Groups**: Community spaces where farmers can **collaborate, share knowledge**, and support each other.
- **Job Portal**: Dedicated **job listings** for laborers and farmers seeking employment opportunities.
- **Chatbot Assistance**: **Gemini API-powered chatbot** answers farmers' questions instantly regarding best practices, schemes, and issues.
